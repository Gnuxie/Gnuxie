Hi, I am maintainer of [Draupnir](https://github.com/Gnuxie/Draupnir),
an open-source community management platform for
[Matrix](https://matrix.org). I have been a Matrix contributor for a
long time, and you should look at some of my
[MSCs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AGnuxie).

Previously I have been employed by
[@element-hq](https://github.com/element-hq) to work on Trust &
Safety.

I am also interested in programming langauge theory and specifically
[capability-safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security)
dynamic-interactive programming languages. A project I keep on the
backburner is an abstract machine to serve as a substrate for a next
generation capability safe programming ecosystem.

This work is best described at the [utena introduction
page](https://applied-langua.ge/~gnuxie/posts/utena-introduction.html),
although this is really old now and there are lots of mistakes.

If you want to learn more about me, then you are welcome to view my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnuxie-lulamoon-a4a1b9397).

If you appreciate the work that I'm doing and you really want to, then
you can donate below.

Thank you 💜
