Hi, I am working on my own object capability language substrate [VM](https://applied-langua.ge/~gnuxie/posts/utena-introduction.html).

I have previously worked on abuse mitigation tooling at [@matrix-org](https://github.com/matrix-org) & [@vector-im](https://github.com/vector-im).

I consider myself a dynamic-interactive object systems hacker and computing maximalist. If you want to learn more about what this means then you should checkout the [blog](https://applied-langua.ge/posts/) that I co-author with [@no-defun-allowed](https://github.com/no-defun-allowed).

If you are still interested, then you are welcome to read my [r√©sum√©](https://applied-langua.ge/~gnuxie/documents/CV_Lulamoon.pdf).
