Hello there, currently I am developing [Draupnir](https://github.com/Gnuxie/Draupnir), an open-source moderation tool for [Matrix](https://matrix.org).
Draupnir is currently undergoing an intensive refactor that will result in the creation of a [library](https://github.com/Gnuxie/matrix-protection-suite) with a powerful plugin interface that can be used by bots, web-clients and widgets alike.
In the background, I'm working on my [own](https://applied-langua.ge/~gnuxie/posts/utena-introduction.html) substrate virtual machine for a new generation of capability based dynamic-interactive programming languages.

I have previously worked on and provided support for open-source abuse mitigation tooling at [@matrix-org](https://github.com/matrix-org) & [@vector-im](https://github.com/vector-im).

I consider myself a dynamic-interactive object systems hacker and computing maximalist. If you want to learn more about what this means then you should checkout the [blog](https://applied-langua.ge/posts/) that I co-author with [@no-defun-allowed](https://github.com/no-defun-allowed).

If you are still interested, then you are welcome to read my [CV](https://applied-langua.ge/~gnuxie/documents/CV_Lulamoon.pdf).

If you appreciate the work that I'm doing and you really want to, then you can donate below. Thank you ðŸ’œ.
