Hello, I am currently developing
[Draupnir](https://github.com/Gnuxie/Draupnir), an open-source
moderation platform for [Matrix](https://matrix.org).  Draupnir has
undergone an intensive refactor that has resulted in the creation of a
[library](https://github.com/Gnuxie/matrix-protection-suite) with a
powerful plugin interface that can be used by bots, web-clients and
widgets alike. Previously I have worked on abuse mitigation tooling at
[@matrix-org](https://github.com/matrix-org) &
[@vector-im](https://github.com/vector-im).

My long term project is an abstract machine that will serve as a
substrate for a new generation of
[capability-safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security)
dynamic-interactive programming languages.  This work is best
described at the [utena introduction
page](https://applied-langua.ge/~gnuxie/posts/utena-introduction.html),
although it's been awhile since I last updated this.

If you want to learn more about me, then you are welcome to read my
[CV](https://applied-langua.ge/~gnuxie/documents/CV_Lulamoon.pdf).

If you appreciate the work that I'm doing and you really want to, then
you can donate below.

Thank you ðŸ’œ
